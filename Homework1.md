2. Discuss in your teams what a decentralised
version of a game like monopoly would be
like, if there was no software on a central
server.
** Answer:

Decentralized version of a game Monopoly:

Core Concepts and Technologies

Blockchain Technology: 

Utilizes a distributed ledger to ensure transparency and fairness. Each player's assets, transactions, and moves are recorded on the blockchain, visible to all participants, ensuring a trustless environment where the game's rules are enforced without a central authority.

Smart Contracts: 

Automate game logic and enforce rules. For example, buying properties, collecting rent, and trading assets are managed by smart contracts, executing transactions automatically when conditions are met.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for Governance: 

Players could form a DAO to vote on rule changes, updates to the game, or resolving disputes, ensuring the game evolves based on community consensus.

Gameplay Mechanics:

Peer-to-Peer Connectivity: 

Players connect directly to each other using a P2P network. The game progresses in turns, with each player's actions broadcasted to all other players, ensuring the game state is synchronized across the network.

Tokenization: 

In-game assets (properties, houses, hotels, and currency) are tokenized as digital assets on the blockchain. This allows for secure ownership, trading, and even the potential to use in-game assets across different games or platforms.

Digital Identity: 

Players use digital wallets to manage their assets and identities within the game. This enables a secure and seamless experience, as well as the possibility to incorporate reputation systems based on players' histories across games.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Integrations: 

Incorporate DeFi elements for more complex economic interactions. For example, players could lend money to each other at agreed interest rates, stake in-game currency to earn rewards, or even create and trade derivatives based on future game outcomes.

Challenges and Considerations:

Latency and Performance: 

Blockchain transactions can take time to confirm, which may introduce latency not present in centralized versions. Solutions might include using faster blockchain protocols or layer-2 solutions to improve transaction speeds.

Complexity for Users: 

The need for a digital wallet and understanding of blockchain concepts might raise the barrier to entry for some players. Educational resources and user-friendly interfaces would be essential.

Regulatory and Legal Issues: 

Tokenizing in-game assets and potentially integrating with DeFi platforms could attract regulatory scrutiny, especially if real money is involved or if it facilitates gambling-like mechanics.

Sustainability and Costs: 

Blockchain operations, especially on networks like Ethereum, can incur significant transaction fees and environmental impacts. Solutions could involve optimizing smart contract efficiency or choosing more sustainable blockchain networks.

Final Thoughts:

A decentralized Monopoly game represents a significant shift towards creating an open, transparent, and player-driven gaming experience. It wwould showcase the potential for decentralized technologies to transform traditional games, making them more dynamic, secure, and potentially interoperable with the broader digital economy. However, it also highlights the challenges in making blockchain-based games accessible and enjoyable for a mainstream audience, requiring innovation in both technology and game design.

Consider what are the essential pieces of functionality?
** Answer:

Key functionalities:

1. Board Setup and Movement:

The Board: 

The Monopoly board is divided into spaces, each representing different properties, utilities, taxes, railroads, Chance and Community Chest cards, Jail, and other special areas like Go, Free Parking, and Go to Jail.

Movement: 

Players move around the board based on the roll of two dice, with the outcome determining where they land.

2. Property Ownership and Transactions:

Acquisition: 

Players can buy properties they land on if not already owned. If the property is owned, they must pay rent to the owner, with amounts specified on the property’s deed card.

Houses and Hotels: 

Players can build houses and hotels on their properties to increase rent, provided they own all properties of the same color group.

Trading: 

Players can trade properties, cash, and get-out-of-jail-free cards with each other.

3. Chance and Community Chest Cards:

Random Events: 

When landing on Chance or Community Chest spaces, players draw cards that can either benefit them, harm them, or affect their standing in the game in various ways.

4. Income and Expenses:

Starting Capital: 

Players start with a predefined amount of money. Income can be earned by collecting rent, passing Go, or other means specified by the game’s rules.

Expenses: 

Money is spent to buy properties, build houses and hotels, pay rent, taxes, or fines, or due to other game events.

5. Jail Mechanics:

Going to Jail: Players can be sent to jail through various means, including landing on the "Go to Jail" space, drawing a certain card, or rolling doubles three times in a row.

Getting Out of Jail: 

Players can get out by paying a fee, using a get-out-of-jail-free card, or rolling doubles on their next turn.

6. Bankruptcy and Elimination:

Bankruptcy: 

If a player cannot pay what they owe, they are declared bankrupt and eliminated from the game. Their assets are handed over to the creditor.

Winning the Game: 

The game continues until all but one player have been bankrupted, with the remaining player declared the winner.

7. Banking and Auctions:

The Bank: 

Handles transactions, property deeds, houses and hotels, and the distribution and collection of money.

Auctions: 

If a player decides not to buy the property they have landed on, it goes to auction, where all players can bid, including the player who declined to buy it.
These functionalities are fundamental to the Monopoly gameplay experience, combining elements of luck (dice rolling, card drawing), strategy (property acquisition, building, trading), and negotiation among players to create a dynamic and competitive environment.

How could people cheat ?
** Answer: 
Cheating in Monopoly:

1. Stealing from the Bank:

Unnoticed Withdrawals: 

A player might take money from the bank without others noticing. This could happen when they are acting as the banker or when other players are distracted.

Underreporting Income: 

Not declaring the full amount when passing Go or collecting rent, thereby keeping extra money.

2. Property Deeds Manipulation:

Hiding Ownership: 

Players might hide the fact that they own a particular property to avoid charging rent, aiming to prolong the game or manipulate negotiations.

False Claims: 

Claiming ownership of a property they don't actually own, hoping others won't notice.

3. Tampering with the Dice:

False Rolls: 

Rolling the dice in a way that they don’t show a fully randomized outcome. Some might perfect a roll that tends to yield higher numbers.

Altering Results: 

Changing the dice results after they've landed but before others have fully seen the outcome.

4. Card Manipulation:

Hiding Cards: 

Keeping Chance or Community Chest cards hidden for personal advantage or not using them when they should.

Selective Drawing: 

Attempting to draw specific cards from the Chance or Community Chest piles by feeling for certain textures or markings.

5. Rule Bending or Ignoring Selective Rule Enforcement: 

Insisting on lesser-known or commonly ignored rules when it benefits them, while ignoring those same rules at other times.
Agreement Breaching: Breaking or “forgetting” about verbal agreements made with other players regarding trades or alliances.

6. Collusion with Other: 

Players Secret Alliances: 

Forming secret agreements with one or more players to the detriment of others, such as intentionally losing to them or giving them favorable deals.

7. Building Irregularities: 

Unauthorized Construction: 

Adding houses or hotels to properties without paying for them or when not allowed by game rules.

Misrepresenting Development: 

Claiming more houses or hotels on a property than there actually are or swapping them between properties to confuse opponents.

__________________________________________________________
How could you prevent them from cheating?
** Answer:
Preventing Cheating:
To ensure a fair and enjoyable game, it’s essential to have clear rules and agreements in place before starting. Consider these:

1. Rotate the Banker Role: 

Change who is the banker periodically to prevent any long-term embezzlement schemes.

2. Use a Neutral Observer: 

If available, a non-playing individual can oversee the game, ensuring rules are followed.

3. Open Bookkeeping: 

Keep transactions transparent. Announce transactions loudly and clearly, and encourage questions if discrepancies are suspected.

4. Clarify Rules: 

Before starting, agree on which official rules and house rules are in play to prevent selective rule enforcement.

3. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital
Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards
decentralisation? Will they help or hinder
adoption of other cryptocurrencies?

** Answer:
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represent a complex intersection between the traditional financial system and the innovative world of digital currencies. Their impact on decentralization and the broader adoption of other cryptocurrencies depends on several factors, including their design, implementation, and the intentions behind their issuance. Let's explore these aspects:

CBDCs and Decentralization:

CBDCs, by their nature, are not a move towards decentralization in the way cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are. CBDCs are issued and regulated by a country's central bank, which retains control over the currency's supply, distribution, and rules of use. This centralized control contrasts with the decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies, where decisions are made through consensus mechanisms and control is distributed among all users.

However, the technology underlying CBDCs, often inspired by blockchain, might introduce some level of transparency and efficiency found in decentralized systems. Still, the governance remains centralized.

Impact on Cryptocurrency Adoption:

The relationship between CBDCs and the adoption of other cryptocurrencies can be multifaceted:

Education and Awareness: 

The introduction of CBDCs by central banks can increase public awareness and understanding of digital currencies in general. This heightened awareness might lead to increased interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies as more people become comfortable with digital and tokenized assets.

Infrastructure and Interoperability: 

The development and deployment of CBDCs might lead to the creation of new financial infrastructure that supports digital currencies. If this infrastructure can interact with decentralized cryptocurrencies, it could ease the exchange between CBDCs and other digital currencies, potentially boosting adoption.

Competition and Coexistence: 

CBDCs could be seen as competitors to existing cryptocurrencies, especially in use cases like digital payments, remittances, and store of value. However, because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer different value propositions, such as decentralization and limited supply, they may coexist with CBDCs, serving different needs and preferences.

Regulatory Implications: 

The rollout of CBDCs might lead to stricter regulations for cryptocurrencies, as governments seek to maintain control over the financial system. This could either hinder the adoption of cryptocurrencies by increasing hurdles for use and investment or could legitimize and stabilize the market, attracting more institutional investors.
Conclusion

While CBDCs themselves are not a move towards decentralization, their introduction will likely have significant implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Whether CBDCs will help or hinder the adoption of other cryptocurrencies is not straightforward and will depend on how they are implemented, regulated, and how the public perceives and uses them relative to existing digital currencies. The potential for both positive and negative impacts exists, and the outcome will likely be a complex interplay of these factors.
